- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, SQLite.

---

### **3. Batch Processing with Spark**
- **Goal**: Process a large dataset (e.g., CSV or JSON files) and compute aggregates like sum, mean, etc.
- **Tools**: Apache Spark, Python (PySpark).

---

### **4. Automate Data Backup**
- **Goal**: Write a pipeline that backs up a database to an S3 bucket daily.
- **Tools**: Python, AWS S3 SDK (boto3), Cron.

---

### **5. Streaming Data with Kafka**
- **Goal**: Set up a Kafka producer to simulate real-time events and a consumer to process them.
- **Tools**: Apache Kafka, Python.

---

### **6. Real-Time Data Pipeline**
- **Goal**: Use Kafka or Kinesis to ingest real-time data and store it in a database.
- **Tools**: Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis, PostgreSQL/MySQL.

---

### **7. Data Lake Setup**
- **Goal**: Ingest raw data (e.g., web logs) into a data lake (e.g., AWS S3) and query it with Athena.
- **Tools**: AWS S3, Athena, Glue.

---

### **8. Database Schema Design**
- **Goal**: Design a relational schema for a movie database and implement it.
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL/MySQL, ER diagram tool.

---

### **9. Implement Data Partitioning**
- **Goal**: Partition a large dataset (e.g., logs by date) for faster queries.
- **Tools**: Hadoop HDFS or PostgreSQL partitioning.

---

### **10. Data Pipeline Orchestration**
- **Goal**: Build a data pipeline that extracts CSV data, transforms it, and stores it in a database, scheduled daily.
- **Tools**: Apache Airflow, Python, PostgreSQL/MySQL.

---

### **11. Data Warehousing**
- **Goal**: Create a star schema in a data warehouse for a retail dataset.
- **Tools**: Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery.

---

### **12. Data Security**
- **Goal**: Encrypt data before storing it in a database and implement role-based access control.
- **Tools**: Python, PostgreSQL/MySQL, PyCrypto.

---

### **13. Monitor ETL Pipeline**
- **Goal**: Add logging and alerts to an ETL pipeline.
- **Tools**: Python logging, Grafana, Prometheus.

---

### **14. Data Validation**
- **Goal**: Implement data validation rules to check for anomalies in a dataset.
- **Tools**: Python, Great Expectations.

---

### **15. Implement a REST API**
- **Goal**: Create a REST API to expose data from a database.
- **Tools**: Flask or FastAPI, PostgreSQL/MySQL.

---

### **16. Build a Data Dashboard**
- **Goal**: Visualize dataset insights on a dashboard.
- **Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, or Python Dash.

---

### **17. Cloud Resource Deployment**
- **Goal**: Use Terraform to provision a cloud database and S3 bucket.
- **Tools**: Terraform, AWS.

---

### **18. Distributed Computing**
- **Goal**: Write a MapReduce job to count word frequency in a text file.
- **Tools**: Hadoop, Python.

---

### **19. CI/CD for Data Pipelines**
- **Goal**: Set up GitHub Actions to test and deploy a data pipeline.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Python.

---

### **20. Real-Time Analytics**
- **Goal**: Use Apache Flink or Spark Streaming to process and analyze real-time data (e.g., stock prices).
- **Tools**: Apache Flink or Spark Streaming, Kafka.
